The "Training Wheels" Shell
========================

</p>

To help you become a bit more acquainted with the [Linux][Linux] [command-line], the [`bash`][bash] shell, a _prototype_ idea is to let you interact with a "training wheels" shell, which tries to kind of hold your hand and guide you through running commands and learning different concepts in [Linux].

It is ___not___, by any means, a complete product or a one-size-fits-all utility. The hope is to see if this works well as a teaching tool -- if it fails and turns out to be a flop, we will move on from it or try a new tactic.

_But_, it is my hope, that this interactive tool will help ingrain commands and syntax into your head, and you will gain a better understanding of how things all fit together in the command-line. Please give feedback, comments, concerns and criticisms as they come to you.

__If this tool does turn out to be a success, I will add more content and "modules" to it as the weeks develop.__

Files & Directory Information
--------


* [`colors.py`](colors.py)
    
    This file and the `.pyc` file act as a quick module to import and use within [Python] to access quick-and-easy shorthand functions to utilize colors.

* [`main.py`](main.py)
    
    This is the main source code of the "training wheels" shell. This is the file you should invoke when you want to run the program. It can be invoked with a simple "dot-slash" syntax, like so:
    
```
./main.py
```

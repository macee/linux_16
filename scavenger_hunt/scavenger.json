			This is a filesystem scavenger hunt for the <a href='http://uscga.edu'>United States Coast Guard Academy</a> 2016 Intro to Linux class!
		</p>
		<p>
			There is not meant to be much \"challenge\" in this scavenger hunt ... but the difficulty should increase 
			as you move through the tasks. It is meant to have you practice and really start to master
			moving around the Linux filesystem and hunting for things.

__[Linux]__ is a computer [operating system], much like [Microsoft Windows], which you are probably already used to working with. _But,_ it is designed for creative people who want to get work done -- engineers, mathematicians, scientists, developers, artists and more.

In this class, we'll be teaching you how to get started with the [Linux][Linux] [command-line], called [`bash`][bash]. You'll be exploring it all on the super-awesome-and-cheap microcomputer, the [Raspberry Pi].

Please go ahead and explore. We'll be diving into more and more of these files as the weeks go on, but the point is to let you be inquisitive and creative -- so take a sneak peak, if you'd like. ;)

Files & Directory Information
--------

[Linux] is all about "[open-source]", so we'll following the same mindset. Everything that was done in preparation for this class is available for you to see, if you are curious about it.

* [`setup/`](setup/)
    
    This folder holds all the files and code used to prepare for the "Intro to Linux" class. It goes over what was done to flash the [Raspbian] OS onto the [MicroSD] cards, and how we created all of the [github] repositories for each student.

* [`training_wheels/`](training_wheels/)
    
    In this directory is the source code and material for the "training wheels" [`bash`] shell that was put together for this course, to create a more interactive learning experience. It was written in [Python] should continue to be maintained throughout the course.

			This CTF competition is all about automating a tool to do things  
			for you;hopefully with it you will learn a lot more  
			<a href='https://www.python.org/'>Python</a>, and feel a bit  
			more powerful when you see how much scripting can really 
			do for you. 
		</p>
		<p> 
			The flags will change every minute, so your goal is to write some 
			code that will retrieve the flag from a service and submit it for 
			you, so there is no intervention by you as the user at all. 
		</p> 
		<p>
			There are some serious modules I recommend to help you do this.  
			This CTF is meant to be used as a way of learning, so please,   
			don't be afraid to ask around how to do this kind of stuff -- in  
			fact, that's what we want. 
		</p>
		<h2>Good luck and have fun!</h2>
